# BOOKMATE

A reading tracker with an e-reader, developed in Flutter for mobile.

#Description:
Readers often have to use multiple applications for tracking their reading progress, discovering new books, and reading e-books. This fragmented experience lacks integration and personalization.
Bookmate solves this by combining these features into a single, seamless application. 
Bookmate combines the functionality of a reading tracker with a fully featured e-reader. Users can maintain personal reading histories, create custom book lists such as “To Read” or “Favourites,” keep track of their reading habits and trends and write reviews or thoughts on the books they've read. Additionally, an integrated EPUB and PDF reader allows users to import their e-books to the application and build a custom library. Features like text selecting, bookmarking and highlighting are avaliable in the application.


#Core Feaatures:
• User registration & login system 
• Reading history tracking 
• Custom book lists (“To Read”, “Favourites” etc.) 
• User reviews 
• Integrated e-reader 
• User-created personal digital library
