# BOOKMATE

A reading tracker with an e-reader, developed in Flutter for mobile.

# Description:

Readers often have to use multiple applications for tracking their reading progress, discovering new books, and reading e-books. This fragmented experience lacks integration and personalization.
Bookmate solves this by combining these features into a single, seamless and personalized application. 

Bookmate integrates a reading tracker with a fully featured e-reader. Users can maintain personal reading histories, create custom book lists (like “To Read” or “Favourites”), track reading habits and trends, and write personal reviews or reflections on the books they've read.

The app also includes a built-in EPUB and PDF reader, allowing users to import and organize their e-books into a custom digital library. Additional features such as text selection, bookmarking, and highlighting enhance the reading experience.
